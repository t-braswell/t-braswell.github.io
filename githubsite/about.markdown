I am a MSc. candidate in Applied Math at San Diego State University. While my educational background is intially in qualitative social science, with undergraduate degrees in Econ/Math and Political Science, for the last few years, I have been working in Mathematics Education. My research interests include real analysis- non-standard analysis in particular- differential equations, bioinformatics, and alternative approaches to calculus and linear algebra education. Outside of this, I am an avid Linux user, long time Magic the Gathering player, and try to volunteer in my community.
