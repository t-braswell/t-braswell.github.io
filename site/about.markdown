I am a MSc. Candidate in Applied Math at San Diego State University. While my educational background is intially in Qualitative Social Science, with undergraduate degrees in Econ/Math and Political Science, for the last few years, I have been working in Mathematics Education. My research interests include Real Analysis- non-standard analysis in particular- Differential Equations, Bioinformatics, and alternative approaches to Calculus and Linear Algebra Education. Outside of this, I am an avid linux user, long time Magic the Gathering Player, and try to volunteer in my community.
